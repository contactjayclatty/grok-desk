# Changelog

## 1.7.1 — 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **README reworked as a landing page.** Features now sit directly under *Why use this?*, descriptions are trimmed to the point (deep technical detail stays in the dedicated docs), and the duplicate *Cost control* / *Context & cost* sections are merged into one. Fresh screenshots for **Context & cost**, **Fork conversation**, and **Queue or steer**, plus a new **Subagents** feature entry; the *Agent Dashboard* section folded into *Session history*, which now hosts the status-dot legend.
- **Smaller vsix** (~4 MB less): four unused screenshots removed and the `/imagine` hero image converted to WebP (2.9 MB → 240 KB).

## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-17

Three requested features, all built on ACP surfaces the Grok Build CLI already ships but never advertises — probe-confirmed against grok 0.2.101 first ([research/grok-build-oss-findings.md](research/grok-build-oss-findings.md) § 3a) and pinned by new real-grok gates.

### Added

- **Steer — redirect Grok mid-turn without interrupting it.** A message sent while Grok works still queues by default; now the pending message carries a **Steer** button that sends it straight into the running turn, so Grok changes course mid-answer. It is not a Stop: the turn keeps its in-flight tool work and finishes normally. **Steer by default** (gear → *Config & debug*, off by default) makes send-while-busy skip the queue entirely; steered text is plain text only (no chips, editor context, or `/commands`), and a CLI that can't steer falls back to queueing rather than losing the message. ([#52](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/52); [src/acp.ts](src/acp.ts), [src/sidebar.ts](src/sidebar.ts), [media/chat.js](media/chat.js))
- **Fork conversation** (gear → *Fork conversation*) — branch the conversation into a new session named `(Fork) <original>`, leaving the original byte-for-byte unchanged in your history. It branches the conversation, **not your code**: files on disk are untouched. ([#48](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/48); [src/acp.ts](src/acp.ts), [src/sessions.ts](src/sessions.ts), [src/sidebar.ts](src/sidebar.ts))
- **Token usage in the context popover.** Click the donut for a **Session total** of what the conversation has billed (input / cache read / output), tracked across every turn, plus a collapsible **Last turn** with the same split and its **model calls** — the number that explains why a turn bills far more than the context it holds. Cache *read* is shown; no cache-*creation* figure exists anywhere in the CLI, so it is omitted rather than faked as zero. ([#53](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/53); [src/acp-dispatch.ts](src/acp-dispatch.ts), [src/sidebar.ts](src/sidebar.ts), [media/chat.js](media/chat.js))

### Changed

- **Compact conversation moved from the gear menu to the context popover** — it is a context action, so it now sits next to the number that tells you when you need it (disabled at 0 tokens). The gear's Session section holds *Fork conversation*. ([media/chat.js](media/chat.js))
- **Usage telemetry adds three feature flags** (`showThinking` / `expandToolDetails` / `steerByDefault`) **and the host app** (VS Code / Cursor / …), so we can see whether our defaults are the ones people keep and which VS Code forks are worth supporting. Still anonymous, one event per session, no content — every field is listed in [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md). ([src/telemetry.ts](src/telemetry.ts))

### Fixed

- **The buttons on a pending message no longer miss while Grok is streaming.** Steer / Edit / Remove act on press instead of click: the pending block sits at the end of the chat, which re-scrolls on every streamed chunk, so the button moved out from under the cursor mid-click. ([media/chat.js](media/chat.js))
