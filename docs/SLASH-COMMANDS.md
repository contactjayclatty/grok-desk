# Slash commands

Slash commands are sourced live from the running CLI via the ACP `available_commands_update` notification — the autocomplete list reflects exactly what your installed `grok` version and auth method expose. Type `/` in the composer to open it.

This page is a snapshot for reference; the autocomplete list is the source of truth. Skills installed under `~/.grok/skills/` or `~/.grok/bundled/skills/` also appear in autocomplete as `/<skill-name>` but are not documented here — they vary per install and are owned by their respective `SKILL.md` files.

Snapshot taken against `grok` v0.1.212.

## Not slash commands

A few things look like slash commands but are surfaced through the extension UI, not the CLI:

- **New session** — sidebar `+` button (`Grok: New Session` from the command palette)
- **Plan mode** — mode picker in the bottom toolbar (currently disabled — see Known limits in `CLAUDE.md`)
- **YOLO mode** — mode picker; toggles auto-approval on the client side
