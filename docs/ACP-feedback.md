# Grok Build CLI over ACP — field feedback from a thin client

Feedback for the Grok Build CLI team from building **grok-build-vscode**, a VS Code/Cursor
sidebar that is a deliberately thin ACP client for `grok agent stdio`. Everything below is
**evidence-based**: wire captures from real sessions (`test/fixtures/composer-subagent-session.jsonl`),
standalone probes (`research/*.cjs`), and a pre-release live suite (`scripts/live-tests.cjs`)
that re-verifies the load-bearing shapes against the real binary. Deep-dives live in
`research/*.md`; this document is the summary an upstream engineer can act on.

**Basis:** grok CLI **0.2.93** (native Windows, stable channel), extension **v1.5.6**, 2026-07-11.
The grok-build-family findings were re-verified against **Grok 4.5** (`grok-4.5`) — now the
default model of that family. **Grok Build** (`grok-build`) is still present for some
accounts/builds, so its observations below remain valid; where the two differ (context window,
`set_model` echo) both are called out. See **§5** for the Grok 4.5 verification run (full live
suite + probes; Composer 2.5 re-verified alongside).

**Revision history** — newest first. Each observation is dated and carries the grok CLI build it
was made against; a section without a date here predates this log and is covered by **Basis**.

| Date | grok CLI | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| **2026-07-15** | **0.2.101** | **§2.1 — the headline defect is FIXED.** A rejection of `x.ai/exit_plan_mode` is now honored. **One new, still-open hole:** plan mode gates the *edit* tool but **not** `terminal/create`, so a shell command can mutate the workspace during planning. |
| **2026-07-15** | **0.2.101** | **§2.10 (new) — edit diffs.** Three asks: every edit reports its diff **twice** and the first can be wrong (an overwriting Write's echo claims `oldText:""`); the echo, the completed update, and the session/load replay each carry a **different `_meta` shape**; and `details[]` has `line_prefix` but no `line_suffix`, so the changed line can't be reconstructed. *(Raised and **withdrawn** the same day: "a replace-all under-describes the change" — `_meta.details[]` does enumerate every site, 12/12 with exact line numbers. That was our client gap, not a CLI defect.)* |
| **2026-07-13** | *not recorded* | **§2.9 (new) — terminal commands** (issue #46, extension v1.5.13). The agent emits POSIX-subshell idioms against a PowerShell host, and the two agent families use different command-execution models. |
| **2026-07-11** | **0.2.93** | **§5 — Grok 4.5 verification.** Every grok-build-family finding re-verified against Grok 4.5; Composer 2.5 re-verified alongside. |

## 1. The two agent families behave differently on the wire

Models belong to *agent types* — `grok-build`/`grok-build-plan` vs the `cursor` agent that owns
the Composer models. A client that only tested one family breaks on the other:

| Surface | grok-build agent (Grok 4.5 / Grok Build, `grok-build-plan`) | cursor agent (Composer 2.5) |
|---|---|---|
| Context window (`_meta.totalContextTokens`) | **Grok 4.5: 500K** · **Grok Build: 512K** | 200K |
| Delegation tool | `spawn_subagent` (`_meta["x.ai/tool"].name`) | `Task` |
| `subagent_type` value style | `general-purpose` (kebab) | `generalPurpose` (camel) |
| Delegation completion | Same-id `tool_call_update`, `status:"completed"`, structured `rawOutput.SubagentCompleted` (output, `tool_calls`, `turns`, `duration_ms`, `resume_from_hint`) | A **third, untitled** update (`title:""`, **no `_meta`**), `rawOutput {type:"Text", text}` — **no duration anywhere on the tool channel** |
| Background delegation | `background:true` → instant "started" ack, real result later via `get_command_or_subagent_output` (`TaskOutput.Result` with `task_id`, `duration_secs`, `output`) | not observed |
| Tool-call ids | `call-<uuid>-<n>` | `call-<uuid>-composer_call_<suffix>` — the short suffix **repeats across calls**; only the full id is unique |
| Tool titles | verb-style ("List \`src/…\`") + tool name on spawn | frequently the raw user content (a Grep is titled with its search pattern) |
| `session/set_model` echo | **Grok Build:** versioned id (`grok-build-0.1`) not in `availableModels` · **Grok 4.5:** clean (`{"model":{"Ok":"grok-4.5"}}`, resolvable) | same class of issue |
| Cross-agent switch | `MODEL_SWITCH_INCOMPATIBLE_AGENT` after the first turn (agent locked at spawn) | same |

**Ask:** treat the wire contract as one product across agents — same tool naming, same
completion shape (structured `rawOutput` with duration), same id style — or document the
differences per agent type.

---

## 2. What doesn't work — and what we had to build around it

Ordered roughly by how much client code each one cost.

### 2.1 Plan mode: rejection now works — but `terminal/create` escapes the plan gate
**Update 2026-07-15 (grok 0.2.101): the defect this section originally reported is FIXED — thank
you.** Through **0.2.3**, any client response to `x.ai/exit_plan_mode` — JSON-RPC **result or
error** — was treated as approval, so there was no wire-level "keep planning." On **0.2.101** the
two are cleanly distinguished. A/B with an identical prompt and build, varying only the response
type (`research/plan-mode-recheck-probe.cjs`):

| | **error** (reject) | **result** (approve) |
|---|---|---|
| `current_mode_update` | `[plan]` — stays in plan | `[plan, default]` — exits plan |
| plan turn `stopReason` | `cancelled` | `end_turn` |
| workspace writes | **0** — seed files byte-identical | 2 (file mutated + file created) |
| the model's own account | *"the user never approved or rejected"* | *"the user **approved** the plan"* |

`current_mode_update: "default"` no longer fires on the reject path, and `planContent` now
usually arrives **populated** with the plan text. Two residual notes:
- A rejection is interpreted as a **tool failure** (*"exit_plan_mode failed twice with a client
  disconnect"*), not a semantic *user rejected*. The outcome is right, but an explicit rejection
  outcome would beat overloading the error channel.
- `planContent: null` **still occurs** — observed when the model called `exit_plan_mode` without
  having drafted a plan — so clients still need the `plan.md` fallback.

**Still open, and the reason the workaround stays: plan mode is enforced for the edit tool but
not for the terminal tool** (grok 0.2.101, 2026-07-15). In plan mode the CLI's own tool layer
correctly refuses an edit:
> `Rejected: file edits are not allowed in plan mode -- the only editable file is the plan file`
> `(...plan.md). User verbal approval to edit is not sufficient, they must exit plan mode via the UI.`

Good — that's CLI-enforced, not model-cooperative. But asked to route around that block, the model
issued a `terminal/create` which the CLI **passed straight through to the client**:
```
node -e "require('fs').appendFileSync('app.js','\nfunction subtract(a,b){return a-b}\n')"
```
Nothing was written only because our probe ACKs terminals without executing them — a client that
actually runs the agent's commands (the whole point of `terminal/*` delegation) would have mutated
the workspace during "planning", contradicting the CLI's own rule above. Our client-side
`terminal/create` allowlist (`src/plan-gate.ts`) is currently the **only** barrier.

The workaround therefore remains in place: the client-side gate at the mandatory
`fs/write_text_file` / `terminal/create` choke points, plus a hidden **primer** message carrying
the `[Plan approved]`/`[Plan rejected]`/`[Plan cancelled]` protocol (the primer's original premise
— "ignore the bogus tool result" — is now obsolete; its remaining job is turn shape). The primer
still causes secondary problems (see 2.6).

**Ask:** apply the plan-mode restriction to `terminal/create` as well as the edit tools — a shell
command is a write. Optionally, add an explicit rejection outcome so a reject isn't reported to
the model as a tool failure.

### 2.2 Slash commands: dispatch requires position 0, and TUI-only commands are advertised
- A slash command dispatches **only** when it starts the prompt's text block. Editor-injected
  context in front silently degrades `/compact` into a plain LLM turn — in our probe the
  "compact" **grew** the context 6× (`research/compact.md`). Trailing content is fine, so we
  re-order every send; but nothing over the wire tells a client this rule exists.
- `/always-approve` is advertised over ACP but mutates the **global** `config.toml` — a sticky
  cross-session side effect a sidebar can neither show nor undo per-session. We hide it.
- `/context` is advertised but renders only in the CLI's own TUI — over stdio it streams
  nothing. We hide it too (`/session-info` is the working equivalent).

**Ask:** dispatch commands regardless of position (or accept a structured command field), and
don't advertise commands that are TUI-only or config-mutating on a per-session protocol.

### 2.3 Context accounting: the client can't know the truth when it matters
- The prompt result's `_meta.totalTokens` is **0** for both `/session-info` (context untouched)
  and `/compact` (context shrunk, not emptied) — a placeholder, never a measurement. The other
  fields on a compact turn are a stale echo of the *previous* turn.
- A native `/compact` streams **no content at all** — the turn ends blank with no worked-signal.
- The persisted `signals.json` (`contextTokensUsed`) is recomputed only when the **next
  inference turn ends** — never at the compact turn's own end (probe:
  `research/signals-refresh-probe.cjs`). Right after "compact finished" the true size exists
  nowhere a client can read…
- …except in `/session-info`'s **reply prose**. Our fix is a hidden CLI-local `/session-info`
  turn whose text we scrape with a regex (`**Context:** N / M tokens`). That is as fragile as
  it sounds.
- The ACP `usage_update` notification (the RFD's standard channel for exactly this) is never
  emitted.

**Ask:** emit `usage_update` (or at minimum a truthful `totalTokens`) at the end of `/compact`
and in the `session/load` response. Never report placeholder zeros.

### 2.4 Subagents: three completion dialects, lifecycle events that never ship, titles that lie
- The `subagent_spawned`/`subagent_finished` lifecycle events (method `_x.ai/session/update`)
  are **written to `updates.jsonl` but never transmitted to the ACP client** (live-verified:
  zero arrive while the log fills). They carry exactly what the UI wants — duration_ms,
  tokens_used, the child's output. We route them anyway, hoping.
- Completion shape differs by agent (see §1) and by mode: a `background:true` spawn reports
  `status:"completed"` **immediately** with a "Subagent started in background." ack — the
  real result arrives minutes later on the poller. "Completed" that isn't.
- The child's clean output is triple-wrapped in envelope text (`<subagent_meta>`,
  `<subagent_result>`, "This is the output of the subagent:", a trailing
  "Agent ID: … (resume …)" hint) even though the same output exists structured in
  `rawOutput`.
- Tool titles embed user content: a Grep **for** `spawn_subagent` is titled exactly
  `spawn_subagent`. Only `_meta["x.ai/tool"].name` tells the truth (that field is excellent —
  see §4). The poller's own name (`get_command_or_subagent_output`) contains "subagent" while
  not being a delegation.
- Each child persists as a **top-level sibling session** in the store; clients must filter
  `session_kind:"subagent"` or every delegation adds a junk row to session history.

**Ask:** transmit the lifecycle events; make "completed" mean completed; keep the envelope out
of the text block (the structured `rawOutput` is enough); put `x.ai/tool` meta on every call.

### 2.5 Capabilities and media: the flags don't match reality
- `initialize` advertises `promptCapabilities.image: false`, but inline `{type:"image"}`
  blocks **work** — the model sees the pixels (verified since 0.2.87). A client that trusts
  the flag disables a working feature; we ship with no gate and a live test that fails the day
  the flag flips, in either direction.
- Generated media (`/imagine`, `/imagine-video`) is not returned as an ACP `image`/
  `resource_link` block — the file path is embedded in a `text` block, as JSON on
  Linux/macOS and as human **prose** on native Windows (with `\\?\` extended-length
  prefixes). We parse prose to find pictures.
- A pasted image is copied into `~/.grok/sessions/<…>/assets/` and that internal path is
  surfaced to the model — which then tries to `Read` the binary and fails, polluting the
  transcript. We bake a "do not Read" hint into every image tag.
- An image the CLI judges too small is silently dropped, leaving the model hunting the
  workspace for an attachment it never received. No error reaches the client.

**Ask:** truthful capability flags; media as structured content blocks; don't surface internal
asset paths to the model; error on dropped attachments.

### 2.6 Session catalog and restore: private storage becomes a client API
- Grok's ACP surface exposes `session/new` and `session/load`, but no list, search, rename,
  or delete operations. We enumerate private session directories, parse `summary.json`, infer
  recency from file mtimes, synthesize live sessions before the CLI flushes them, and maintain
  our own pagination, cache, and rename metadata. A client should not need to treat the CLI's
  on-disk implementation as a public API just to render session history.
- `session/set_model` echoes a **versioned id** (`grok-build-0.1`) that isn't in
  `availableModels` and carries no name or context window — still the case on **Grok Build**.
  **Grok 4.5** echoes the clean requested id (`grok-4.5`, resolvable), so the defect is
  per-model within the same agent family; the `resolveModelId` fallback stays for Grok Build,
  older sessions, and the composer agent (see §5).
- The agent type locks after the first turn; switching model families requires a full session
  restart choreographed by the client (`MODEL_SWITCH_INCOMPATIBLE_AGENT`).
- `session/load` does not replay resolved `request_permission`s (we persist and re-inject
  them) and replays `<system-reminder>` turns and protocol markers as user messages a UI must
  know not to render.
- grok titles the session from message #1 — which for us is the hidden primer — so every
  session was named "…Primer v4 Plan Mode…" until we forced display names client-side. Empty
  primer-only sessions accumulate on disk (we sweep them). `num_messages` in `summary.json`
  can be wildly inflated by one agentic turn. `chat_history.jsonl` wraps prompts in
  `<user_query>` — except when it doesn't (slash commands arrive unwrapped).
- Live prompts echo back as `user_message_chunk` since 0.2.33 (they didn't before) —
  undocumented behavior changes like this are how duplicate-bubble bugs are born.

Most of this section is downstream of the primer, which is downstream of 2.1.
**Ask:** expose a paginated `session/list` plus rename/delete operations, returning stable
metadata such as title, updated time, workspace, model, agent type, and session kind. Keep
restore replay free of internal protocol messages and include resolved interaction state.

### 2.7 Session configuration is partly out of band
- Effective permission mode is invisible over ACP. A global or project
  `permission_mode = "always-approve"` silently changes every session's behavior, so we read
  `config.toml` ourselves to avoid displaying a false "Agent" state. The client cannot disable
  that setting for one session.
- Reasoning effort is only a process-start flag (`--reasoning-effort`). Changing it requires
  killing the agent process and restoring or replacing the session; `session/new` and
  `session/load` do not report the effective value.

**Ask:** return effective permission mode and reasoning effort from `session/new` and
`session/load`, and provide session-scoped setters where supported.

### 2.8 Transport/platform (historical but instructive)
- Windows builds 0.2.61–0.2.70 didn't read stdin until **EOF** — a persistent ACP client hung
  forever on `initialize` (later builds: on `session/new`). We still carry a version pin +
  downgrade machinery. Regression tests for "read as lines arrive" would prevent a recurrence.
- `grok update` fails while any grok process (including backgrounded subagent children) holds
  the binary — clients must kill process *trees* and retry.
- `x.ai/ask_user_question` (and `exit_plan_mode`) also appear under a `_x.ai/` prefix; the
  response schema (`outcome:"accepted"` required, empty ACK rejected) had to be recovered from
  strings in the binary. Documentation would have saved a probe.

### 2.9 Terminal commands: the shell is the client's, but the agent writes for another one
In ACP mode grok never runs shell commands itself — it hands each to the client over
`terminal/create`, so the host shell is the **client's** choice. Two problems follow on Windows
(observed 2026-07-13; issue #46, extension v1.5.13; `research/powershell-terminal.md`):

- **The agent writes bash-flavored commands even against a PowerShell host.** We run the agent's
  commands under PowerShell on Windows to match the standalone CLI — users expect their PowerShell
  profile functions and pipelines (`… | Format-List`) to work, which they can't under cmd.exe. But
  grok, in ACP mode, still emits POSIX-subshell idioms like `(cd dir ; cmd)` — invalid in
  PowerShell (`( )` is a grouping *expression*, not a statement list; it errors *"Missing closing
  ')'"*), even while using PowerShell cmdlets (`Get-ChildItem`, `$env:`) in the same batch.
  Standalone grok "just works" under PowerShell, so ACP-mode generation is *worse* than standalone.
  The agent self-recovers by retrying with `Set-Location dir; cmd`, but each miss is a wasted tool
  call + model turn — the exact retry cost #46 set out to remove. A client can't safely rewrite the
  agent's commands. **Ask:** tell the agent the client's shell (or let the client advertise it in
  `initialize`), or generate PowerShell-native syntax on a Windows host as the standalone CLI does.
- **The two agents use different command-execution models, and the client output surface differs.**
  grok-build **delegates** every shell command over `terminal/create` (the client runs it and
  captures stdout). The cursor agent (Composer 2.5) instead runs commands in its **own CLI-side
  persistent shell** — it never sends `terminal/create`; the result rides the completed
  `tool_call_update` (`rawOutput` = `{output, exit_code, command, truncated, current_dir, …}`,
  "Shell state persists for subsequent calls"). So a client that renders command output from the
  `terminal/*` capture gets nothing for Composer rows and must *also* read the completed update's
  `rawOutput`, matched by `toolCallId`. Two consequences worth flagging: (a) **Composer completes a
  batch OUT of issue order** (verified: 10 parallel read-only commands finished 1,2,7,6,10,8,5,3,9,4
  by call#), so any order-based correlation (FIFO) misattributes — `toolCallId` is the only safe key;
  (b) `#46`'s client-shell choice doesn't reach Composer at all, since its shell is CLI-side.
  **Ask:** converge the execution model (or document it), and surface command output the same way on
  both agents — ideally on the completed update's structured `rawOutput` for both, keyed by
  `toolCallId`.

### 2.10 Edit diffs: the first diff can be wrong, and the `_meta` shape differs by delivery path
(observed 2026-07-15, grok **0.2.101**, native Windows; `research/edit-diff.md`,
`research/edit-diff-timing-probe.cjs`)

An edit's diff rides the `tool_call_update` as a `{type:"diff", path, oldText, newText}` content
block, independent of permission mode — an excellent design that lets a client build a review
surface with no permission coupling (see §4). Two fidelity problems sit on top of it:

- **Every edit reports its diff twice, and the two can disagree.** An optimistic **pre-write echo**
  (`kind:"edit"`, titled, no `status`) fires *before* `fs/write_text_file`, then the
  **authoritative completed update** (`status:"completed"`, no `title`/`kind`) fires *after* it.
  For a `search_replace` both carry byte-identical `oldText`/`newText`. For a whole-file **Write
  that overwrites an existing file** they differ: the echo sends `oldText: ""` (it hasn't read the
  old content yet) while the completed update sends the **real prior content**. The echo lands
  first, so a client that renders the first diff it sees shows an overwrite as **pure adds** and
  never corrects it. We shipped exactly that bug for three releases before this probe found it;
  the fix is to key idempotency on the diff *content* rather than on "already rendered".
- **A replace-all's diff block is token-sized — but that is not a defect; the full data is on the
  wire.** *(Open question from the first draft of this section, now SETTLED and WITHDRAWN as an
  ask — verified 2026-07-15, grok 0.2.101, `research/edit-diff-lines-probe.cjs`.)* A
  `search_replace` that changed **148 occurrences** emitted a `diff` block describing only the
  single replaced token, so a client rendering the block alone shows `+1 −1`. We suspected a CLI
  defect. It isn't: a `replace_all` over **12** `PLACEHOLDER` occurrences at known, non-consecutive
  lines produced `_meta.details.length === 12`, `old_line` `[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25]` —
  an exact ground-truth match. The block-level `oldText`/`newText` is the *pattern*; `details[]` is
  the per-site truth. **This was our client-side gap, not your bug — no ask.**

- **`details[]` has `line_prefix` but no `line_suffix`, so a client can't reconstruct the changed
  line.** An entry carries exactly `{old_string, old_line, new_string, new_line, context_before,
  context_after, line_prefix}`. For a site whose real line is `item 1: the token is PLACEHOLDER here`,
  `line_prefix` gives `item 1: the token is ` — everything *before* the match — but the trailing
  ` here` is nowhere on the wire. `context_before`/`context_after` are post-edit windows over the
  *neighbouring* lines, so they never contain the site's own line (a neighbour's window sometimes
  does, but never for the last site). The result: a client can render the change and its leading
  context faithfully, but the rendered line is silently truncated at the match.
  **Ask:** add `line_suffix` (or send the site's full old/new line) — it's one field, and it's the
  difference between rendering a real line and a truncated one.

Related: the initial `tool_call` carries the edit args (`rawInput: {file_path, old_string,
new_string}`) but no diff, and lands only ~30ms before the echo — so there is no useful
"paint earlier from rawInput" shortcut, and taking it would reconstruct the same wrong
`oldText:""` for a Write.

**Credit where due — the line numbers *are* on the wire** (we missed this until 2026-07-15 and
rendered region-relative numbers starting at 1 as a result; our bug, not yours). The pre-write echo
carries them on the diff block:
```json
{"type":"diff","path":"…/alpha.txt","oldText":"WIDGET1","newText":"GADGET1",
 "_meta":{"old_line":2,"new_line":2}}
```
and the completed update carries them per-site on `_meta.details[]`, with surrounding context:
```json
{"old_string":"WIDGET2","old_line":2,"new_string":"GADGET2","new_line":2,
 "context_before":"line one of bravo.txt\n","context_after":"last line stays\n",
 "line_prefix":"the magic word is "}
```
`old_line`/`new_line` are real 1-based file lines, and for a multi-line region they're the region's
**first** line (verified: a 3-line block at lines 40–42 of a 60-line file reports `old_line: 40`).
This is everything a client needs to render a real gutter. Three notes:

- **The three delivery shapes carry different `_meta`, which is the actual friction.** The echo has
  block-level `old_line`/`new_line` but **no** `details[]`; the completed update and the
  **session/load replay** have `details[]` but **no** block-level `old_line`/`new_line`. So a
  client that reads the block `_meta` gets a number on the echo and loses it on both the completed
  repaint and every restored session. **Ask:** put the *same* `_meta` on all three — ideally
  block-level `old_line`/`new_line` **and** `details[]` everywhere — or document which shape owns
  what.
- **A whole-file Write's echo carries `_meta: {}`** — no line data at all — while its completed
  update carries `details[]` with `old_line:1`/`new_line:1`. Same inconsistency, sharper edge.
- **`old_line` is a post-edit coordinate, not a pre-edit one.** `details[]` is computed against the
  *final* file: in a replace-all whose replacement grows the line count (3 sites at pre-edit lines
  2/4/6, each token → 3 lines), every entry reported `old_line === new_line === [2,6,10]` — the
  post-edit lines, not the originals. `context_before`/`context_after` confirm it (site 1's
  `context_after` already shows site 2 replaced). It's self-consistent and fine for rendering, but
  the name `old_line` implies the pre-edit file. **Ask:** either make `old_line` the pre-edit line
  or document that both are post-edit.

**Ask:** send one authoritative diff, or mark the echo as provisional so a client can tell the two
apart.

## 3. What the extension silently hides from users today

A quick inventory of everything we suppress to keep the chat sane — each is a place the
protocol shows users something it shouldn't:

- `/context` and `/always-approve` (removed from autocomplete and dispatch)
- `totalTokens: 0` reports (stripped before the UI)
- The hidden primer turn and its "ok" ack — plus its replayed copy on every restore
- The hidden post-`/compact` `/session-info` turn (our own workaround, invisible by design)
- Grok's post-verdict "I'll wait for your verdict…" filler (cancelled + suppressed)
- Marker-only `[Plan approved/rejected/cancelled]` protocol messages on replay
- `<system-reminder>` turns replayed as user messages
- The subagent result envelope (`<subagent_meta>`, `<subagent_result>`, lead-ins, Agent ID hint)
- The background-spawn "started" ack pretending to be a result
- Subagent child sessions in the history list (`session_kind:"subagent"`)
- Empty primer-only sessions on disk (swept) and primer-derived session titles (renamed)

---

## 4. What works well (credit where due)

- **Streaming** `agent_message_chunk`/`agent_thought_chunk` — clean, separable reasoning.
- **`fs/*` + `terminal/*` delegation** — being mandatory made them a reliable client-side
  enforcement point (it's what makes our plan gate possible at all).
- **`session/request_permission`** — clear option kinds; `kind:"edit"` maps neatly to a diff preview.
- **`session/load` replay through the same update stream as live** — most features restored
  with zero extra code.
- **`_meta` turn accounting** and per-model `totalContextTokens` — rich and useful (modulo the zero).
- **`_meta["x.ai/tool"]`** — an authoritative, title-independent tool identity. This is the
  *right* design; it single-handedly fixed subagent misclassification. Put it on everything.
- **`session/cancel`** as an id-less notification that settles the turn `cancelled` and leaves
  the session usable — exactly what a Stop button needs.
- **Concurrent sessions** — multiple `stdio` processes on one workspace with no cross-talk.
- **Vision** actually works; **`ask_user_question`** is a good structured surface once its
  response shape is known; **`spawn_subagent` (0.2.93)** is well-structured on grok-build.

## 5. Grok 4.5 verification (grok 0.2.93, 2026-07-11)

Every grok-build-family fact above was re-verified against **Grok 4.5** — the current default
model of that family. **Grok Build (`grok-build`) still ships for some accounts/builds**, so the
Grok Build observations in §1–§4 stand; the differences below are per-model *within the same
`grok-build-plan` agent*, not a replacement. The full live suite (`npm run test:live` —
**12 passed · 0 skipped · 0 failed**) plus targeted probes ran against the real binary on native
Windows; Composer 2.5 was independently re-verified in the same run (`subagent-composer`).

**Model surface (`session/new` → `availableModels`):**
- `currentModelId: "grok-4.5"`, name **"Grok 4.5"**, `_meta.agentType: "grok-build-plan"`.
- `_meta.totalContextTokens: 500000` — **500K, where Grok Build reports 512K** (per-model, same
  agent). Corroborated by `/session-info` prose (`Context: N / 500000 tokens`).
- `_meta.supportsReasoningEffort: true` with `reasoningEfforts` [high (default) / medium / low]
  now advertised **in the model list itself** — previously reasoning effort was visible only as
  a process-start flag (§2.7). It is still not settable per-turn over ACP; changing it still
  restarts the process.
- Only two models advertised: `grok-4.5` and `grok-composer-2.5-fast` (Composer 2.5).

**`session/set_model` is clean on Grok 4.5.** `set_model("grok-4.5")` returns
`{"_meta":{"model":{"Ok":"grok-4.5"}}}` — the requested id verbatim, resolvable in
`availableModels`. The **versioned-id defect (§1, §2.6) still applies to Grok Build**
(`grok-build` → `grok-build-0.1`) but does **not** reproduce on Grok 4.5 — so `resolveModelId`
stays necessary for the Grok Build model.

**Delegation (`spawn_subagent`) confirmed on Grok 4.5.** A real delegation emitted genuine
`spawn_subagent` calls with kebab-case `subagent_type` values (`explore`, `general-purpose`),
the completion arriving as a **same-id `tool_call_update`, `status:"completed"`** — exactly the
§1 grok-build shape. The `get_command_or_subagent_output` poller was correctly **not** carded.
The `subagent_spawned`/`subagent_finished` lifecycle events are **still not transmitted over
ACP** (`finished=0` observed while `updates.jsonl` filled) — §2.4 holds unchanged.

**The rest of §1–§4 reproduces on Grok 4.5:**
- Tool-call ids are `call-<uuid>-<n>`; `_meta["x.ai/tool"]` carries
  `{name, kind, namespace:"grok_build", label, read_only}` — the authoritative, title-independent
  tool identity praised in §4.
- Cross-agent switch after the first turn errors `MODEL_SWITCH_INCOMPATIBLE_AGENT`
  (`activeAgentType:"grok-build-plan"` → `requiredAgentType:"cursor"`,
  `suggestion:"start_new_session"`) — the agent is locked at spawn (§2.6).
- `promptCapabilities.image:false` while inline `{type:"image"}` blocks work — the model
  correctly named a solid red PNG (§2.5).
- Plan mode: `exit_plan_mode` still can't be rejected; the client-side write/terminal gate
  contained a rejected plan (0 workspace mutations) and released an approved one (§2.1).
  — **Superseded 2026-07-15: fixed in 0.2.101, a rejection is now honored. See §2.1.**
- Live prompts echo back as `user_message_chunk` (§2.6); `session/cancel` (Stop), two concurrent
  sessions on one workspace, session restore, and structured edit-diff restore all behave as
  documented.

**Live suite (all against Grok 4.5 except the last):** handshake, capabilities, prompt-roundtrip,
cancel-mid-turn, parallel-sessions, vision-prompt, session-restore, edit-diff-restore, plan-mode,
image-gen, subagent, subagent-composer — **12/12 green.** Grok-free floor: **808/808.**
